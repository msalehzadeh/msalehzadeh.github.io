Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm currently immersed in the world of academia as a Ph.D. student in the Mathematics Department at Simon Fraser University. Under the guidance of esteemed advisors, Dr. John Stockie and Dr. Ailene MacPherson, I'm passionately delving into research that bridges the realms of epidemiology, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and theoretical biology. My journey in academia began with a thirst for knowledge, leading me to pursue a Master of Science degree at Simon Fraser University, which I completed in 2022. During this time, I collaborated closely with Dr. John Stockie, exploring the intricate dynamics of jellyfish locomotion and feeding behaviors through the lens of numerical simulations. Prior to my M.Sc., I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science Faculty at the AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polyhechnic) in 2019. This formative experience laid the groundwork for my interdisciplinary approach to research, blending mathematical rigor with computational prowess.
