My research integrates mathematical biology, evolution, and ecology to address critical questions about ecosystem dynamics. Currently, I am investigating the evolution of seed masting, a plant reproductive strategy characterized by synchronized and large-scale seed production. My work explores when masting is neutral or deleterious, the ecological conditions enabling its evolution, and its broader implications for conservation and sustainable forestry under climate change. Alongside, I model bark beetle infestations, combining epidemiological and computational approaches to inform management strategies for these destructive pests. Previously, during my Masterâ€™s, I applied numerical simulations to study jellyfish swimming, uncovering the fluid-structure interactions that drive their movement and feeding.
