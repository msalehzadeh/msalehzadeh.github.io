My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical biology, evolution and ecology, where I apply a combination of theoretical, computational, and analytical approaches to address complex ecological and evolutionary problems. My work is broadly motivated by understanding the dynamics of ecosystems, particularly the mechanisms underlying seed masting (masting) strategies and bark beetle infestations.

Currently, my PhD research focuses on the evolution of masting—a phenomenon characterized by intermittent, synchronized, and large seed production in plant populations. The overarching goal of my work is to uncover the ecological and evolutionary drivers of masting and assess its broader consequences. Specifically, my research addresses three key questions:

**1. When is masting deleterious or neutral in the absence of evolution of synchrony (EOS)?**

I challenge the prevailing assumption that masting is inherently disadvantageous under such conditions.

**2. Under what ecological conditions does masting evolve?** 

Using theoretical and simulation-based approaches, I aim to determine the drivers of this reproductive strategy.

**3. What are the conservation and management consequences of masting?** 

I assess how masting impacts forest dynamics, particularly in the context of climate change, and its implications for sustainable forestry practices.

To tackle these questions, I employ ecological models such as predator-prey and host-parasite models, and use of Floquet analysis, and individual-based simulations, leveraging stochastic and deterministic frameworks. My collaborative efforts with forestry experts further enhance the practical applications of my research.

Beyond masting, I am investigated bark beetle infestations, a pressing ecological issue that threatens forest ecosystems globally. My work combines epidemiological and computational methods to model the dynamics of bark beetle outbreaks and their interactions with host trees. By refining assumptions in earlier studies and exploring parameter sensitivity, I aim to provide actionable insights for managing these destructive pests.

Previously, during my Master’s program, I conducted research on jellyfish swimming and feeding dynamics using numerical simulations. By employing the immersed boundary method, I explored the fluid-structure interaction between jellyfish and their surrounding fluid. This work revealed insights into their propulsion mechanics, feeding strategies, and pair-wise interactions, laying the groundwork for future studies on jellyfish swarms.
